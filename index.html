This document also contains examples that contain characters that are invalid
JSON, such as inline comments (`//`) and the use of ellipsis
(`...`) to denote information that adds little value to the example.
Implementers are cautioned to remove this content if they desire to use the
information as a valid document.

Examples provided throughout this document include descriptive properties, such
as `name` and `description`, with values in English to simplify the concepts in
each example of the specification. These examples do not necessarily reflect the
data structures needed for international use, described in more detail in
