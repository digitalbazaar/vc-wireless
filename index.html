      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
[=Credentials=] are integral to our daily lives; driver's licenses confirm our
capability to operate motor vehicles, university degrees assert our level of
education, and government-issued passports permit travel between countries. The
[[[?VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] specification provides a mechanism to express these
sorts of [=credentials=] on the Web in cryptographically secure,
privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable way. At times it is useful to be able
to transmit these sorts of credentials in a peer-to-peer setting where wide area

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Legacy Presentation</h3>

          <p>
The State of Utopia's digital transformation team would like to transition their
vendors to use the [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] but would like to continue to support
legacy systems using their proprietary NFC transit passes. They would like to
instruct their new vendors to embed the legacy NFC transit pass codes into the
new [=verifiable credentials=] that they will be issuing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Non-Interactive Presentation</h3>

          <p>
Ricardo purchased a movie ticket online and would like to use his mobile
device to present the digital ticket at the entry gate at the
movie theatre.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Interactive Presentation</h3>

          <p>
Summer is crossing the border into Utopia and would like to use her new
digital permanent resident card to speed her transit through the border
crossing. In order to use the digital permanent resident card, border control
challenges her devices to demonstrate that it is among the devices that
Utopia resident services verified when they first issued the digital permanent
resident card to Summer. This requires the border control software to send
a cryptographic challenge to Summer's device, which it fulfils along with
providing her permanent resident card, allowing Summer to cross the border.

        <section>
          <h3>Wireless Protocol Upgrade</h3>

          <p>
Ular is a digital notary in a rural area of their country and, after verifying
the physical documents that Lora has provided, encodes digital images for each
of them and includes them in a [=verifiable credential=] with Ular's digital
signature. In order to transmit them to Lora, Ular needs a high bandwidth
channel as data transmission over the mobile phone network is costly and slow
in their area. Ular's software, which is configured to choose more cost
effective options, choses to send the [=verifiable credential=] over a
peer-to-peer short range wireless protocol.

        <section>
          <h3>Optical Initiation</h3>

          <p>
Mel would like to check out at a retail location which does not have any
non-payment NFC technologies in their point of sale, but does support WiFi and
Bluetooth at the store. Mel generates a QR Code and scans it at the point of
sale to enable it to connect to their phone over Bluetooth to complete the
transaction.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>

        <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts in this specification.
        </p>

        <dl class="termlist definitions">
          <dt><dfn class="export">interaction offer</dfn></dt>
          <dd>
A protocol that [=issuers=], [=holders=], and [=verifiers=] use to determine
the protocols over which an interaction can occur.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Interaction Offers</h2>

      <p>
An [=interaction offer=] is a protocol that peers use to determine the protocols
over which an interaction can occur. The protocol is composed of one peer
providing an <dfn class="external">interaction offer URL</dfn> while the other
peer fetches the <dfn class="external">interaction offer response</dfn>. An
example of the [=interaction offer URL=] is provided below:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="A simple interaction offer URL">
https://interaction.example/interactions/123/request
      </pre>

      <p>
The URL consists of the following query parameters:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>nfc</dt>
        <dd>
An OPTIONAL parameter that, if present, specifies that further communication
can occur over NFC.
        </dd>
        <dt>bt</dt>
        <dd>
An OPTIONAL parameter that, if present, specifies Bluetooth connection details
such as address and access credentials. An example of such a URL is:
`btspp://00:11:22:33:FF:EE:97c44c80-5fcc-11ef-81a2-bf5f90ac9110;vcapi`
        </dd>
        <dt>wifi</dt>
        <dd>
An OPTIONAL parameter that, if present, specifies WiFi connection details
such as an access point address and access credentials. An example of such a
URL is: `WIFI:S:38f2bcc5a0b71;T:WPA;P:J3Klq9c2KlPPcJkwzU02K;;vcapi`
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
When a request is made to the [=interaction offer URL=] URL, an
[=interaction offer response=] is provided. An example of an interaction offer
response is provided below:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="An interaction offer response">

      <h2>Verifiable Credentials Over NFC</h2>

      <p>
The NFC protocol is used to wirelessly communicate between devices in a
peer-to-peer fashion. It's range is typically limited to 10 centimeters or less
based on the power levels used by the NFC device. The following sections
describe how NFC can be used to request and receive verifiable credential
presentations over NFC using the [[[WEB-NFC]]] specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Non-interactive NFC Presentation</h3>

        <p>
Non-interactive NFC transmission of [=verifiable presentations=] are useful
when the presentation of the information in a [=verifiable credential=] is
enough to proceed with a workflow without needing to provide a challenge
to the [=holder=] of the [=verifiable credential=] such as the use of a
bearer token such as a public transit card or movie ticket.
        </p>

        <p>
To perform such a [=presentation=], the [=holder=] is expected to use their
device to select a [=verifiable credential=] for transmission and activate their
device to transmit the information contained in `payload` value of the NFC
`renderMethod` entry.
        </p>

        <p>
For example, given the [=verifiable credential=] below:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="Verifiable Credential containing an NFC render method with a legacy payload">

        <p>
Note that in the example above, the only information transmitted over NFC is
the `credentialSubject.renderMethod.payload` value, which while unsigned,
allows for the transmission of any legacy fixed NFC payload value.
        </p>

        <p>
If an [=issuer=] desires to enable the transmission of a
[=verifiable credential=] over NFC, they can encode one in the payload. Doing
such an encoding can be made more efficient by compressing the
[=verifiable credential=] using [[[CBOR-LD]]]. For example, the following
[=verifiable credential=] contains an NFC payload that is a CBOR-LD encoded
[=verifiable credential=]:
        </p>

        <h3>Interactive NFC Presentation</h3>

        <p>
Interactive [=presentation=] over NFC is useful when a [=verifier=] needs to
engage with a [=holder=] in a way that requires more than one message to be
exchanged. Examples of this interaction pattern include a [=verifier=] providing
a [=verifiable credential=] to the [=holder=] that demonstrates that the
[=verifier=] has a legitimate need for the information that they are requesting.
Another example using this interaction pattern is when the [=verifier=]
desires to send a cryptographic challenge to the [=holder=] such that the
[=holder=] can increase the confidence that the [=verifier=] has that the
[=holder=] is the [=subject=] of the [=verifiable credential=] that has been
requested.
        </p>

        <p>
An interactive NFC presentation starts with a [=interaction offer=] as
described in Section [[[#interaction-offers]]] and then uses a [[[VC-API]]]
workflow to perform the exchange. See
<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/#workflows-and-exchanges">Workflows
and Exchanges</a> in the [[[VC-API]]] for the specific messages exchanged
between the NFC peers to achieve an interactive presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
An example interactive exchange is shown below for performing a DID-based
authentication over NFC.

        <h3>Protocol Upgrades From NFC</h3>

        <p>
An application that desires to share a [=verifiable presentation=] might detect
that continuing over an NFC channel will create a bad experience for the
[=holder=] due to NFC limitations such as bandwidth, transmission distance, or
latency. In these instances, when starting from an NFC-based [=interaction
offer=], it is possible to upgrade to a more ideal transmission medium.
        </p>

        <p>
In order to upgrade from NFC, an implementation merely does not include
NFC options resulting in an [=interaction offer=] that looks similar to the
following:

      <h2>Verifiable Credentials Over Bluetooth</h2>

      <p>
The Bluetooth protocol is used to wirelessly communicate between devices in a
peer-to-peer fashion. It's range is typically limited to 10 meters or less
based on the power levels used by the Bluetooth device. The following sections
describe how Bluetooth can be used to request and receive verifiable credential
presentations over Bluetooth using the [[[WEB-BLUETOOTH]]] specification.
      </p>

        <h3>Interactive Bluetooth Presentation</h3>

        <p>
Interactive [=presentation=] over Bluetooth is useful when a [=verifier=] needs to
engage with a [=holder=] in a way that requires more than one message to be
exchanged. Examples of this interaction pattern include a [=verifier=] providing
a [=verifiable credential=] to the [=holder=] that demonstrates that the
[=verifier=] has a legitimate need for the information that they are requesting.
Another example using this interaction pattern is when the [=verifier=]
desires to send a cryptographic challenge to the [=holder=] such that the
[=holder=] can increase the confidence that the [=verifier=] has that the
[=holder=] is the [=subject=] of the [=verifiable credential=] that has been
requested.
        </p>

        <p>
An interactive Bluetooth presentation starts with a [=interaction offer=] as
