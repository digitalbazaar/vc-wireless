## Verifiable Credentials Over Wireless Protocols

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to assert
that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees can be used
to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports enable us to
travel between countries. The
[Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) specification
establishes a data model to express these sorts of credentials on the Web in a
way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and
machine-verifiable.

This specification establishes a number of wireless protocols that can be used
to request and present verifiable credentials over electromagnetic communication
devices such ones supporting Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions also occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list.

This specification is EXPERIMENTAL and is NOT INTENDED for production
deployment.
